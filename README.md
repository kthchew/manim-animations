# Manim Animations
A collection of personal animations for various concepts, created with Manim

## What is this?

This is a collection of scripts I've used to create small animations in [Manim](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/). They're a bit messy, and the code may not be great.

## Using

[Install Manim](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html), then use the appropriate Manim command. For example, to see the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, run

```
manim -p -ql science/boltzmann_distribution.py BoltzmannDistribution
```
